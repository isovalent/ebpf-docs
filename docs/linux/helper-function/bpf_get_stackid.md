<!-- [HELPER_FUNC_DEF] -->
Walk a user or a kernel stack and return its id. To achieve this, the helper needs _ctx_, which is a pointer to the context on which the tracing program is executed, and a pointer to a _map_ of type **BPF_MAP_TYPE_STACK_TRACE**.

The last argument, _flags_, holds the number of stack frames to skip (from 0 to 255), masked with **BPF_F_SKIP_FIELD_MASK**. The next bits can be used to set a combination of the following flags:

**BPF_F_USER_STACK**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect a user space stack instead of a kernel stack.

**BPF_F_FAST_STACK_CMP**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compare stacks by hash only.

**BPF_F_REUSE_STACKID**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If two different stacks hash into the same _stackid_, discard the old one.

The stack id retrieved is a 32 bit long integer handle which can be further combined with other data (including other stack ids) and used as a key into maps. This can be useful for generating a variety of graphs (such as flame graphs or off-cpu graphs).

For walking a stack, this helper is an improvement over **bpf_probe_read**(), which can be used with unrolled loops but is not efficient and consumes a lot of eBPF instructions. Instead, **bpf_get_stackid**() can collect up to **PERF_MAX_STACK_DEPTH** both kernel and user frames. Note that this limit can be controlled with the **sysctl** program, and that it should be manually increased in order to profile long user stacks (such as stacks for Java programs). To do so, use:

```
# sysctl kernel.perf_event_max_stack=<new value>
```

### Returns

The positive or null stack id on success, or a negative error in case of failure.

`#!c static long (* const bpf_get_stackid)(void *ctx, void *map, __u64 flags) = (void *) 27;`

# Helper function `bpf_get_task_stack`

<!-- [HELPER_FUNC_DEF] -->
Return a user or a kernel stack in bpf program provided buffer. Note: the user stack will only be populated if the _task_ is the current task; all other tasks will return -EOPNOTSUPP. To achieve this, the helper needs _task_, which is a valid pointer to **struct task_struct**. To store the stacktrace, the bpf program provides _buf_ with a nonnegative _size_.

The last argument, _flags_, holds the number of stack frames to skip (from 0 to 255), masked with **BPF_F_SKIP_FIELD_MASK**. The next bits can be used to set the following flags:

**BPF_F_USER_STACK**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect a user space stack instead of a kernel stack. The _task_ must be the current task.

**BPF_F_USER_BUILD_ID**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect buildid+offset instead of ips for user stack, only valid if **BPF_F_USER_STACK** is also specified.

**bpf_get_task_stack**() can collect up to **PERF_MAX_STACK_DEPTH** both kernel and user frames, subject to sufficient large buffer size. Note that this limit can be controlled with the **sysctl** program, and that it should be manually increased in order to profile long user stacks (such as stacks for Java programs). To do so, use:

```
# sysctl kernel.perf_event_max_stack=<new value>
```

### Returns

The non-negative copied _buf_ length equal to or less than _size_ on success, or a negative error in case of failure.

`#!c static long (*bpf_get_task_stack)(struct task_struct *task, void *buf, __u32 size, __u64 flags) = (void *) 141;`

<!-- [HELPER_FUNC_DEF] -->
Get a bpf_local_storage from an _inode_.

Logically, it could be thought of as getting the value from a _map_ with _inode_ as the **key**.  From this perspective,  the usage is not much different from **bpf_map_lookup_elem**(_map_, **&**_inode_) except this helper enforces the key must be an inode and the map must also be a **BPF_MAP_TYPE_INODE_STORAGE**.

Underneath, the value is stored locally at _inode_ instead of the _map_.  The _map_ is used as the bpf-local-storage "type". The bpf-local-storage "type" (i.e. the _map_) is searched against all bpf_local_storage residing at _inode_.

An optional _flags_ (**BPF_LOCAL_STORAGE_GET_F_CREATE**) can be used such that a new bpf_local_storage will be created if one does not exist.  _value_ can be used together with **BPF_LOCAL_STORAGE_GET_F_CREATE** to specify the initial value of a bpf_local_storage.  If _value_ is **NULL**, the new bpf_local_storage will be zero initialized.

### Returns

A bpf_local_storage pointer is returned on success.

**NULL** if not found or there was an error in adding a new bpf_local_storage.

`#!c static void *(* const bpf_inode_storage_get)(void *map, void *inode, void *value, __u64 flags) = (void *) 145;`

<!-- [HELPER_FUNC_DEF] -->
For socket policies, prevent the execution of the verdict eBPF program for message _msg_ until _bytes_ (byte number) have been accumulated.

This can be used when one needs a specific number of bytes before a verdict can be assigned, even if the data spans multiple **sendmsg**() or **sendfile**() calls. The extreme case would be a user calling **sendmsg**() repeatedly with 1-byte long message segments. Obviously, this is bad for performance, but it is still valid. If the eBPF program needs _bytes_ bytes to validate a header, this helper can be used to prevent the eBPF program to be called again until _bytes_ have been accumulated.

### Returns

0

`#!c static long (* const bpf_msg_cork_bytes)(struct sk_msg_md *msg, __u32 bytes) = (void *) 62;`

# Helper function `bpf_csum_diff`

<!-- [HELPER_FUNC_DEF] -->
Compute a checksum difference, from the raw buffer pointed by _from_, of length _from_size_ (that must be a multiple of 4), towards the raw buffer pointed by _to_, of size _to_size_ (same remark). An optional _seed_ can be added to the value (this can be cascaded, the seed may come from a previous call to the helper).

This is flexible enough to be used in several ways:

* With _from_size_ == 0, _to_size_ > 0 and _seed_ set to
  checksum, it can be used when pushing new data. * With _from_size_ > 0, _to_size_ == 0 and _seed_ set to
  checksum, it can be used when removing data from a packet. * With _from_size_ > 0, _to_size_ > 0 and _seed_ set to 0, it
  can be used to compute a diff. Note that _from_size_ and   _to_size_ do not need to be equal.

This helper can be used in combination with **bpf_l3_csum_replace**() and **bpf_l4_csum_replace**(), to which one can feed in the difference computed with **bpf_csum_diff**().

### Returns

The checksum result, or a negative error code in case of failure.

`#!c static __s64 (*bpf_csum_diff)(__be32 *from, __u32 from_size, __be32 *to, __u32 to_size, __wsum seed) = (void *) 28;`

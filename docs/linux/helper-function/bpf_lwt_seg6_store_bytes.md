# Helper function `bpf_lwt_seg6_store_bytes`

<!-- [FEATURE_TAG](bpf_lwt_seg6_store_bytes) -->
[:octicons-tag-24: v4.18](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/fe94cc290f535709d3c5ebd1e472dfd0aec7ee79)

<!-- [HELPER_FUNC_DEF] -->
Store _len_ bytes from address _from_ into the packet associated to _skb_, at _offset_. Only the flags, tag and TLVs inside the outermost IPv6 Segment Routing Header can be modified through this helper.

A call to this helper is susceptible to change the underlying packet buffer. Therefore, at load time, all checks on pointers previously done by the verifier are invalidated and must be performed again, if the helper is used in combination with direct packet access.

### Returns

0 on success, or a negative error in case of failure.

`#!c static long (* const bpf_lwt_seg6_store_bytes)(struct __sk_buff *skb, __u32 offset, const void *from, __u32 len) = (void *) 74;`

# Helper function `bpf_override_return`

<!-- [FEATURE_TAG](bpf_override_return) -->

<!-- [HELPER_FUNC_DEF] -->
Used for error injection, this helper uses kprobes to override the return value of the probed function, and to set it to _rc_. The first argument is the context _regs_ on which the kprobe works.

This helper works by setting the PC (program counter) to an override function which is run in place of the original probed function. This means the probed function is not run at all. The replacement function just returns with the required value.

This helper has security implications, and thus is subject to restrictions. It is only available if the kernel was compiled with the **CONFIG_BPF_KPROBE_OVERRIDE** configuration option, and in this case it only works on functions tagged with **ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION** in the kernel code.

Also, the helper is only available for the architectures having the CONFIG_FUNCTION_ERROR_INJECTION option. As of this writing, x86 architecture is the only one to support this feature.

### Returns

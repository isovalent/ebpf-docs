# Helper function `bpf_sysctl_set_new_value`

<!-- [FEATURE_TAG](bpf_sysctl_set_new_value) -->

<!-- [HELPER_FUNC_DEF] -->
Override new value being written by user space to sysctl with value provided by program in buffer _buf_ of size _buf_len_.

_buf_ should contain a string in same form as provided by user space on sysctl write.

User space may write new value at file position > 0. To override the whole sysctl value file position should be set to zero.

### Returns

0 on success.

**-E2BIG** if the _buf_len_ is too big.

**-EINVAL** if sysctl is being read.

`#!c static long (* const bpf_sysctl_set_new_value)(struct bpf_sysctl *ctx, const char *buf, unsigned long buf_len) = (void *) 104;`

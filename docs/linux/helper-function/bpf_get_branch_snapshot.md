# Helper function `bpf_get_branch_snapshot`

<!-- [FEATURE_TAG](bpf_get_branch_snapshot) -->
[:octicons-tag-24: v5.16](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/856c02dbce4f8d6a5644083db22c11750aa11481)

<!-- [HELPER_FUNC_DEF] -->
Get branch trace from hardware engines like Intel LBR. The hardware engine is stopped shortly after the helper is called. Therefore, the user need to filter branch entries based on the actual use case. To capture branch trace before the trigger point of the BPF program, the helper should be called at the beginning of the BPF program.

The data is stored as struct perf_branch_entry into output buffer _entries_. _size_ is the size of _entries_ in bytes. _flags_ is reserved for now and must be zero.



### Returns

On success, number of bytes written to _buf_. On error, a negative value.

**-EINVAL** if _flags_ is not zero.

**-ENOENT** if architecture does not support branch records.

`#!c static long (*bpf_get_branch_snapshot)(void *entries, __u32 size, __u64 flags) = (void *) 176;`

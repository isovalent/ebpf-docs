Flush stats in `cgrp`'s subtree

## Definition

Collect all per-cpu stats in `cgrp`'s subtree into the global countersand propagate them upwards. After this function returns, all cgroups in the subtree have up-to-date ->stat.

This also gets all cgroups in the subtree including `cgrp` off the ->updated_children lists.

This function may block.

**Parameters**

`cgrp`: target cgroup

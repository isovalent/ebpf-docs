# KFunc `bpf_cpumask_create`

<!-- [FEATURE_TAG](bpf_cpumask_create) -->
[:octicons-tag-24: v6.3](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/516f4d3397c9e90f4da04f59986c856016269aa1)
<!-- [/FEATURE_TAG] -->

Create a mutable BPF cpumask.

## Definition

Allocates a cpumask that can be queried, mutated, acquired, and released by
a BPF program. The cpumask returned by this function must either be embedded
in a map as a kptr, or freed with [`bpf_cpumask_release()`](bpf_cpumask_release.md).

`bpf_cpumask_create()` allocates memory using the BPF memory allocator, and
will not block. It may return NULL if no memory is available.

<!-- [KFUNC_DEF] -->
`#!c struct bpf_cpumask *bpf_cpumask_create()`

!!! note
	This kfunc returns a pointer to a refcounted object. The verifier will then ensure that the pointer to the object 
	is eventually released using a release kfunc, or transferred to a map using a referenced kptr 
	(by invoking [`bpf_kptr_xchg`](../../helper-function/bpf_kptr_xchg.md)). If not, the verifier fails the 
	loading of the BPF program until no lingering references remain in all possible explored states of the program.

!!! note
	The pointer returned by the kfunc may be NULL. Hence, it forces the user to do a NULL check on the pointer returned 
	from the kfunc before making use of it (dereferencing or passing to another helper).

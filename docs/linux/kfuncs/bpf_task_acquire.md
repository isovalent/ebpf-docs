# KFunc `bpf_task_acquire`

<!-- [FEATURE_TAG](bpf_task_acquire) -->
[:octicons-tag-24: v6.2](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/3f00c52393445ed49aadc1a567aa502c6333b1a1)
<!-- [/FEATURE_TAG] -->

Acquire a reference to a task. 

## Definition

A task acquired by this kfunc which is not stored in a map as a kptr, must be released by calling[`bpf_task_release()`](bpf_task_release.md).

`p`: The task on which a reference is being acquired.

<!-- [KFUNC_DEF] -->
`#!c struct task_struct *bpf_task_acquire(struct task_struct *p)`

!!! note
	This kfunc returns a pointer to a refcounted object. The verifier will then ensure that the pointer to the object 
	is eventually released using a release kfunc, or transferred to a map using a referenced kptr 
	(by invoking [`bpf_kptr_xchg`](../../helper-function/bpf_kptr_xchg.md)). If not, the verifier fails the 
	loading of the BPF program until no lingering references remain in all possible explored states of the program.

!!! note
	The pointer returned by the kfunc may be NULL. Hence, it forces the user to do a NULL check on the pointer returned 
	from the kfunc before making use of it (dereferencing or passing to another helper).

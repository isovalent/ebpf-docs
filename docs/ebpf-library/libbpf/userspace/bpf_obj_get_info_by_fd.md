# Libbpf userspace function `bpf_obj_get_info_by_fd`

<!-- [LIBBPF_TAG] -->
[:octicons-tag-24: 0.0.1](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/releases/tag/v0.0.1)
<!-- [/LIBBPF_TAG] -->

Low level wrapper around the [`BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD`](../../../linux/syscall/BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD.md) syscall command.

## Definition

`#!c int bpf_obj_get_info_by_fd(int bpf_fd, void *info, __u32 *info_len);`

**Parameters**

- `bpf_fd`: file descriptor of the BPF object
- `info`: buffer to store the information about the BPF object
- `info_len`: indicates the size of the buffer which `info` points to and will be changed by the syscall command to the actual amount of data written to the `info` buffer

**Return**

`0`, on success; negative error code, otherwise

## Usage

This function allows you to retrieve information about a BPF object by its file descriptor. The information will be written to `info`, the structure of the info depends on the underlying object type.

### Example

This example demonstrates how to use `bpf_obj_get_info_by_fd` to retrieve an eBPF programâ€™s ID from its file descriptor.
The `prog_fd` could be obtained, for example, via [`bpf_program__fd`](bpf_program__fd.md) or other methods.

```c
struct bpf_prog_info info = {0};
__u32 len = sizeof(info);
if (bpf_obj_get_info_by_fd(prog_fd, &info, &len) < 0)
    printf("Failed to get info\n");
else
    printf("Program ID: %u\n", info.id);
```

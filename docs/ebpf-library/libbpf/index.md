# Libbpf

Libbpf is the reference library for eBPF development. It is developed and maintained as [part of the kernel tree](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/tools/lib/bpf) often in lockstep with the kernel itself. Since including the whole kernel tree in a project is not practical, a mirror of just the libbpf library is maintained at [https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf).

Libbpf has both userspace components and eBPF components. The eBPF components are mostly pre-processor statements, forward declarations, and type definitions that make it easier to write eBPF programs. The userspace components are a library used for loading eBPF programs and interacting with the loaded resources.

# Concepts

## [BPF CO-RE] (Compile Once - Run Everywhere)
It enables the development of portable BPF programs by integrating kernel BTF type information, Clang compiler support for relocation, and libbpf loader adjustments, ensuring compatibility across different kernel versions without runtime compilation overhead.

## [BTF] (BPF Type Format)
It is compact, efficient format for describing C program type information. It enables runtime accessibility of kernel types crucial for BPF program development and verification.

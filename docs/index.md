# eBPF Docs

Welcome to the eBPF Docs! eBPF is an amazing technology which enables its users to extend the functionality of operating systems in a fast and secure way. eBPF is powerful, but also very complex, especially for newcomers. 

This site aims to provide technical documentation for eBPF. If you are looking for specific information, we recommend you to use the search feature in to top right. You can use the navigation bar on the left for a hierarchal view, or use the condensed table of contents below to jump to a particular general topic.
